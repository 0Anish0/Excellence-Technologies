Help the user select a poll category in a conversational way. The available categories are:
- Technology (tech, software, gadgets, phones, computers, AI, etc.)
- Politics (elections, government, parties, candidates, policies, etc.)
- Entertainment (movies, sports, music, games, celebrities, etc.)
- Other (for topics that don't fit above)

If the user says something like "it's about elections" or "about cricket" - recognize that as Politics or Entertainment immediately without asking again. Make the interaction feel natural.

If the user just mentions a topic, try to identify which category it belongs to and confirm it. If unclear, explain briefly that categories help organize polls for easier discovery.`;

    case 'topic':
      return `${baseText}

The user has selected "${state.category}" as their poll category. Now guide them to provide a main topic or question for their poll in a natural, conversational way.

Be helpful but brief. The question should be specific enough to get meaningful responses.

For example:
- Technology: "Which smartphone feature is most important to you?"
- Politics: "Which policy issue matters most in the upcoming election?"
- Entertainment: "What's your favorite movie genre?"

Once they provide a suitable topic/question, acknowledge it enthusiastically and move to options.`;

    case 'options':
      return `${baseText}

The user has provided "${state.topic}" as their poll topic/question. Now help them add at least 2 options for voters to choose from in a conversational way.

If they provide comma-separated options directly, accept them. If they seem unsure, offer to suggest some options based on their topic.

Good options should be:
- Clear and concise
- Relevant to the topic
- Distinct from each other

Example options for "Which smartphone feature is most important to you?":
1. Camera quality
2. Battery life
3. Processing speed
4. Storage capacity

Be helpful but keep your responses conversational and brief.`;

    case 'confirm':
      return `${baseText}

The user has provided all the details for their poll:
- Category: ${state.category}
- Topic/Question: ${state.topic}
- Options: ${state.options?.join(', ')}

Ask them to confirm in a natural way. They can reply with "confirm" to create the poll, "edit" to make changes, or "cancel" to start over.

If they say anything that implies confirmation (like "yes", "sure", "looks good"), treat it as confirmation and create the poll.`;
